Requirements:

1. Interface should be a "RESTful" web service
2. web service accepts a number as input and rerturns that many numbers of the Fibonacci number sequence
3. web service should reject non positive numbers
4. Deployment instructions
5. Include unit tests
6. code must be able to be deployed and maintained for 5 years


Assumptions:
1. A zero value returns an empty sequence
2. PUT verb not supported
3. RESTful interface uses an underlying request object.
    a. POST creates a request that can be retrieved by Include
    b. DELETE removes request by Id
    c. Get with no id provides a list of all records.
    d. No pagination for get all
    e. Get with an id retrieves a particular record
4. Database backups would be handled as part of the postgres administration


Potential issues:
1. Processing for a large range could take longer than the request timeout
    a. As part of future maintenance and work processing should be handled by a separate process
    b. Sequence should be part of the get only.   It's currently being returned in the POST
2. To be more of a REST interface it should be using the same request datamodel and submitting 
    that as the data of the request with the correct verb.
